  abstract={Semiconductor photodiodes were developed in the early `Forties approximately at the time when the photomultiplier tube became a commercial product (RCA 1939). Only in recent years, with the invention of the Geiger-mode avalanche photodiodes, have the semiconductor photo detectors reached sensitivity comparable to that of photomultiplier tubes. The evolution started in the `Sixties with the p-i-n (PIN) photodiode, a very successful device, which is still used in many detectors for high energy physics and a large number of other applications like radiation detection and medical imaging. The next step was the development of the avalanche photodiode (APD) leading to a substantial reduction of noise but not yet achieving single photon response. The weakest light flashes that can be detected by the PIN diode need to contain several hundreds of photons. An improvement of the sensitivity by 2 orders of magnitude was achieved by the development of the avalanche photodiode, a device with internal gain. At the end of the millennium, the semiconductor detectors evolved with the Geiger-mode avalanche photodiode into highly sensitive devices, which have an internal gain comparable to the gain of photomultiplier tubes and a response to single photons. A review of the semiconductor photo detector design and development, the properties and problems, some applications and a speculative outlook on the future evolution will be presented.}

In this paper we present experimental results which show that SiPMs can be used in positron emission tomography (PET). As scintillator we use the newly developed LYSO material, which has very similar characteristics to the widely used LSO. With our setup we measure an energy resolution of (21.5 plusmn;0.5)% and a coincidence time resolution of (1.51 plusmn;0.07) ns, both full width at half maximum. A significant improvement in time resolution could be achieved by triggering on the first photoelectron in the signal. We also present the coincidence rate of two detector channels vs. the position of a small pointlike 22Na positronium source.},
