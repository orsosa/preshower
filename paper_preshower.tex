\begin{abstract}
A crucial problem in any particle detector and specially at high energies is the need to distinguish particles very close to each other, an example of this is the detection of neutral pions that decay into two gammas with small opening angle. The problem is of particular interest to any Electron Ion Collider due to the relatively high rate of photons, electrons and positrons in the electron scattering environment.\\

To address this problem we present a crystal-based electromagnetic pre-shower using a novel readout system and new LYSO crystals allowing an efficient design and large resolution when separating very close particles. \\

While silicon-tungsten based pre-showers have been proposed for this purpose, the study of a crystal-based design is important in order to understand different options with very different properties and cost point, which could also be used for the exploration of hybrid designs. 

The use of a novel readout design that minimize the amount of not sensitive materials and the use of new LYSO crystals allowing unprecedented compactness in sensitive calorimetric measurements allows a highly efficient design with large spatial resolution.

The detector consist of a 25x25 matrix of crystals (LYSO). Each crystal has dimensions 4x4x45 (mm) and is covered by a reflector sheet (Vikuiti-ESR de 3M). The reflector was added to it using a thermoformation procedure. The light from the matrix is collected using wavelength shifting fibers (Y11(200)M). The net of fibers was mounted in UVT acrylic. At the end of each WLSF there is small light guide (UVT acrylic) connected to a Multi-pixel photon counter (Hamamatsu S10931-025P) to measure the photons collected.

\section{Readout}
The readout consist of 50 MPPC distributed into 25 per axis. Each MPPC has its own bias (CAEN A1519B) and its own amplifier. The amplifiers are connected to a QCD (CAEN V792), reading each channel individually.\\
In order to test the performance of the pre-shower the following setup was built:
At the top of the pre-shower there is a Muon detector, bellow the pre-shower there is a small calorimeter and bellow this another Muon detector. The trigger for the acquisition system is generated by a coincidence of the two Muon detectors. In this way the pre-shower was tested using Muons coming from cosmic rays. In order to test the readout, a set of data was collected using different orientations of the pre-shower. A total of 300000 Muons events were analized ( \~ one week of measurements).

Studies on the effect of incident particles on the components of the pre-shower detector has been preformed in order to detect any abnormality.

\section{Conclusions}
\begin{itemize}
\item An efficient procedure of construction of the pre-shower has been created, the studies performed during the construction of the first prototype will allow us to build a new version with improved performance.
\item The first prototype has shown good performance regarding the correlation of energy measurements obtained from the two independent axes, using data collected from cosmic Muons.
\item The full simulation of the pre-shower has been implemented. Initial results has shown improvements in spatial resolution.
\item The reconstruction algorithm for the pre-shower has been designed and tested with simulations. The test against real data will be done in the future.
\end{itemize}
